\section{Introduction}

...

An XOR-XNOR-based hybrid full adder design has been proposed\cite{20212210429416}
which uses an XOR-XNOR module combined with the carry-generation module and the sum-generation module.
As the designers discussed, it is a scalable and full-swing FA
with some performance improvements compared with several existing state-of-the-art FAs.

in section 2, xxx will be discussed...

\section{FA-1: XOR-XNOR-based Hybrid Full Adder}

\subsection{Design}

The FA-1\cite{20212210429416} design, which was proposed in 2021, contains three modules to perform a 1-bit full adder operation.
Firstly, an XOR-XNOR circuit will take original inputs \(A\) and \(B\) as its input and produce two signals,
one is from the XNOR gate marked as \(S_{xnor\_out}\) and the other is from the XOR gate marked as \( S_{xor\_out}\).
Then, a TG-based circuit as the second module will take both signal and the input carry \(C_{in}\) to calculate the \(Sum\)
while a third module will then use the \(C_{in}\) along with \(A\), \(B\) and signals \(S_{xnor\_out}\), \( S_{xor\_out}\) to generate the carry \(C_{out}\).

Fig. \ref{fig:fa1-bd} presents the block diagram of the design.

\subsubsection{Module 1}XOR-XNOR Circuit Design

The circuit consists of 10 transistors as is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fa1-xor-xnor}.

\end{figure}

For all the possible \(A\), \(B\) inputs,
table \ref{tb:xor-xnor} presents all the output patterns also the responsible transistors within the circuit.
As the table presented, it is clear that at least one transistor path can provide full swing output to prevent threshold voltage loss.

\subsubsection{Module 2}Sum Generation Circuit

From the Table \ref{tb:fa-tf}, two paths for the \(Sum\) generation can be concluded:

when \(C_{in} = 0\):
\[
	Sum = A \oplus B
\]

when \(C_{in} = 1\):
\[
	Sum = A \varodot B
\]

For input selection, a 2:1 Multiplexer(2:1 MUX) based on Transmission Gate(TG) has been used for the \(Sum\) generation.

As is given in Fig. \ref{fig:fa1-circuit}, two TGs are used for implementing 2:1 MUX logic and with this manner,
the \(Sum\) generation circuit can also provide full swing output.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Module 3}Carry Generation Circuit

As per Fig. \ref{fig:fa1-circuit}, the \(Carry\) generation circuit uses a CCMOS logic-based inverter at the output.
With this logic, the output voltage level of this circuit is either \(V_{dd}\) or \(G_{nd}\) level.
It is a good design for the extensibility of the circuit
since the design of the carry generation logic is the most important factor of the scalability of the wide word length adders.


\subsection{Discussion}

FA-1 shows impressive improvements compared to many other FAs.
The presenters are intended to solve the voltage degradation issue with the hybrid logic-based design,
hence they design the XOR-XNOR-based circuit to produce full swing output for its next stage
and choose TG for implementing the sum generation circuit.

Finally, for the purpose of high-speed calculations and good scalabilities,
they apply the CCMOS technique at the output terminial.
The designed carry generation circuit can be extended to multiple bits adder structures with no additional voltage level restoring buffers.
Furthermore, this logic can reduce the carry chain delay with involving just one pull-up and pull-down transistors.

As for the area overhead, a total of 22 transistors are used to produce this FA, namely, 10 on module one, 4 on module 2, and 8 on module 3.

According to the presenters' simulation using 45nm technique and 1 voltage supply on 1-bit FA,
compare with the conventional CMOS FA\cite{weste2015cmos} and other recent FA designs\cite{9068497,18743001},
% this design has 19.35\% improvement in Silicon area, 33.59\% improvement in Average Power, 36.15\% improvement in Propagation Delay, 56.22\% improvement in Area Delay Product, and 57.59\% improvement in Power Delay Product.
this design achieves many improvements which can be shown in the Table \ref{tb:fa1-comparison}.
