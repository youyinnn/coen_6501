\section{Introduction}

...

An XOR-XNOR-based hybrid full adder design has been proposed\cite{20212210429416}
which uses an XOR-XNOR module combined with the carry-generation module and the sum-generation module.
As the designers discussed, it is a scalable and full-swing FA
with some performance improvements compared with several existing state-of-the-art FAs.

in section 2, xxx will be discussed...

\subsection{Background}

The proposer of the design fist discussed how important ..

\subsection{Design}

This FA design contains three modules to perform a 1-bit full adder operation.
Firstly, an XOR-XNOR circuit will take original inputs \(A\) and \(B\) as its input and produce two signals,
one is from the XNOR gate marked as \(S_{xnor\_out}\) and the other is from the XOR gate marked as \( S_{xor\_out}\).
Then, a TG-based circuit as the second module will take both signal and the input carry \(C_{in}\) to calculate the \(Sum\)
while a third module will then use the \(C_{in}\) along with \(A\) and \(B\) and signals \(S_{xnor\_out}\) and \( S_{xor\_out}\) to generate the carry \(C_{out}\).

Fig. \ref{fig:fa1-bd} presents the block diagram of the design.
