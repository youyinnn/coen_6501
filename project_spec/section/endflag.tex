\section{End Flag Generator}

To generate a valid \(end\_flag\) signal for the ALU, a Timed Mealy State Machine is introduced into the circuit.
For instance, a pipelining circuit will result in the output after counting 4 synchronized clock cycles
when the \textquote{load} signal goes from high to low. The counting of the clock cycle is implemented by rotating a
vector signal to avoid inrtoducing extra addition circuit.

The ASMD chart is presented in \figref{fig:asmd}.
And the RTL description of the generator is presented in \figref{fig:end_flag_gen_rtl}.
