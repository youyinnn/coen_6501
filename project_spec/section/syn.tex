\section{Synthesis and Analysis of the Arithmetic Circuit}

\subsection{Introduction}

The arithmetic circuit is synthesized for implementation on a field-programmable grid array (FPGA).
Xilinx Virtex-II Pro is used as the FPGA in this project.
Mentor Graphics PrecisionRTL is used to generate and synthesize the circuits,
which also details the area usage and can perform timing analysis if needed.
Xilinx ISE is used for getting the timing and power information.
% Also, the timing analysis is done by Xilinx ISE, the result of which is shown in Appendix X.

\subsection{Results for the Non-Pipelined Version}
\subsubsection{Implementation with Negation Output}
\paragraph{Area}

When synthesizing the non-pipelined version, the total number of slices used was 377 or 4.06\% 
of all available logic slices. The full report from Mentor Graphics PrecisionRTL regarding the area
and resource used is shown in \appref{sec:ap_1}.

\paragraph{Power}

\noindent The power information was performed with Xilinx ISE. The results are shown in the \tbref{tb:non_p_power}.
